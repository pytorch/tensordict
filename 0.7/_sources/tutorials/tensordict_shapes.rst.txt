Manipulating the shape of a TensorDict
======================================
**Author**: `Tom Begley <https://github.com/tcbegley>`_

In this tutorial you will learn how to manipulate the shape of a :class:`~.TensorDict`
and its contents.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 11-16

When we create a :class:`~.TensorDict` we specify a ``batch_size``, which must agree
with the leading dimensions of all entries in the :class:`~.TensorDict`. Since we have
a guarantee that all entries share those dimensions in common, :class:`~.TensorDict`
is able to expose a number of methods with which we can manipulate the shape of the
:class:`~.TensorDict` and its contents.

Indexing a ``TensorDict``
-------------------------

Since the batch dimensions are guaranteed to exist on all entries, we can index them
as we please, and each entry of the :class:`~.TensorDict` will be indexed in the same
way.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 32-41

.. code-block:: Python


    a = torch.rand(3, 4)
    b = torch.rand(3, 4, 5)
    tensordict = TensorDict({"a": a, "b": b}, batch_size=[3, 4])

    indexed_tensordict = tensordict[:2, 1]
    assert indexed_tensordict["a"].shape == torch.Size([2])
    assert indexed_tensordict["b"].shape == torch.Size([2, 5])








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 42-49

Reshaping a ``TensorDict``
--------------------------

:meth:`TensorDict.reshape <tensordict.TensorDict.reshape>` works just like
:meth:`torch.Tensor.reshape`. It applies to all of the contents of the
:class:`~.TensorDict` along the batch dimensions - note the shape of ``b`` in the
example below. It also updates the ``batch_size`` attribute.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 49-56

.. code-block:: Python



    reshaped_tensordict = tensordict.reshape(-1)
    assert reshaped_tensordict.batch_size == torch.Size([12])
    assert reshaped_tensordict["a"].shape == torch.Size([12])
    assert reshaped_tensordict["b"].shape == torch.Size([12, 5])








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 57-65

Splitting a ``TensorDict``
--------------------------

:meth:`TensorDict.split <tensordict.TensorDict.split>` is similar to
:meth:`torch.Tensor.split`. It splits the :class:`~.TensorDict` into chunks. Each
chunk is a :class:`~.TensorDict` with the same structure as the original one, but
whose entries are views of the corresponding entries in the original
:class:`~.TensorDict`.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 65-71

.. code-block:: Python


    chunks = tensordict.split([3, 1], dim=1)
    assert chunks[0].batch_size == torch.Size([3, 3])
    assert chunks[1].batch_size == torch.Size([3, 1])
    torch.testing.assert_close(chunks[0]["a"], tensordict["a"][:, :-1])








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 72-104

.. note::

   Whenever a function or method accepts a ``dim`` argument, negative dimensions are
   interpreted relative to the ``batch_size`` of the :class:`~.TensorDict` that the
   function or method is called on. In particular, if there are nested
   :class:`~.TensorDict` values with different batch sizes, the negative dimension is
   always interpreted relative to the batch dimensions of the root.

      >>> tensordict = TensorDict(
      ...     {
      ...         "a": torch.rand(3, 4),
      ...         "nested": TensorDict({"b": torch.rand(3, 4, 5)}, [3, 4, 5])
      ...     },
      ...     [3, 4],
      ... )
      >>> # dim = -2 will be interpreted as the first dimension throughout, as the root
      >>> # TensorDict has 2 batch dimensions, even though the nested TensorDict has 3
      >>> chunks = tensordict.split([2, 1], dim=-2)
      >>> assert chunks[0].batch_size == torch.Size([2, 4])
      >>> assert chunks[0]["nested"].batch_size == torch.Size([2, 4, 5])

   As you can see from this example, the
   :meth:`TensorDict.split <tensordict.TensorDict.split>` method behaves exactly as
   though we had replaced ``dim=-2`` with ``dim=tensordict.batch_dims - 2`` before
   calling.

Unbind
------
:meth:`TensorDict.unbind <tensordict.TensorDict.unbind>` is similar to
:meth:`torch.Tensor.unbind`, and conceptually similar to
:meth:`TensorDict.split <tensordict.TensorDict.split>`. It removes the specified
dimension and returns a ``tuple`` of all slices along that dimension.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 104-110

.. code-block:: Python


    slices = tensordict.unbind(dim=1)
    assert len(slices) == 4
    assert all(s.batch_size == torch.Size([3]) for s in slices)
    torch.testing.assert_close(slices[0]["a"], tensordict["a"][:, 0])

Stacking and concatenating
--------------------------

:class:`~.TensorDict` can be used in conjunction with ``torch.cat`` and ``torch.stack``.

Stacking ``TensorDict``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Stacking can done lazily or contiguously. A lazy stack is just a list of tensordicts
presented as a stack of tensordicts. It allows users to carry a bag of tensordicts
with different content shape, device or key sets. Another advantage is that
the stack operation can be expensive, and if only a small subset of keys is required,
a lazy stack will be much faster than a proper stack.
It relies on the :class:`~tensordict.LazyStackedTensorDict` class.
In this case, values will only be stacked on-demand when they are accessed.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 125-148

.. code-block:: Python


    from tensordict import LazyStackedTensorDict

    cloned_tensordict = tensordict.clone()
    stacked_tensordict = LazyStackedTensorDict.lazy_stack(
        [tensordict, cloned_tensordict], dim=0
    )
    print(stacked_tensordict)

    # Previously, torch.stack was always returning a lazy stack. For consistency with
    # the regular PyTorch API, this behaviour will soon be adapted to deliver only
    # dense tensordicts. To control which behaviour you are relying on, you can use
    # the :func:`~tensordict.utils.set_lazy_legacy` decorator/context manager:

    from tensordict.utils import set_lazy_legacy

    with set_lazy_legacy(True):  # old behaviour
        lazy_stack = torch.stack([tensordict, cloned_tensordict])
    assert isinstance(lazy_stack, LazyStackedTensorDict)

    with set_lazy_legacy(False):  # new behaviour
        dense_stack = torch.stack([tensordict, cloned_tensordict])
    assert isinstance(dense_stack, TensorDict)




.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    LazyStackedTensorDict(
        fields={
            a: Tensor(shape=torch.Size([2, 3, 4]), device=cpu, dtype=torch.float32, is_shared=False),
            b: Tensor(shape=torch.Size([2, 3, 4, 5]), device=cpu, dtype=torch.float32, is_shared=False)},
        exclusive_fields={
        },

        device=None,
        is_shared=False,
        stack_dim=0)




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 149-151

If we index a :class:`~.LazyStackedTensorDict` along the stacking dimension we recover
the original :class:`~.TensorDict`.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 151-155

.. code-block:: Python


    assert stacked_tensordict[0] is tensordict
    assert stacked_tensordict[1] is cloned_tensordict








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 156-159

Accessing a key in the :class:`~.LazyStackedTensorDict` results in those values being
stacked. If the key corresponds to a nested :class:`~.TensorDict` then we will recover
another :class:`~.LazyStackedTensorDict`.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 159-162

.. code-block:: Python


    assert stacked_tensordict["a"].shape == torch.Size([2, 3, 4])








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 163-186

.. note::

   Since values are stacked on-demand, accessing an item multiple times will mean it
   gets stacked multiple times, which is inefficient. If you need to access a value
   in the stacked :class:`~.TensorDict` more than once, you may want to consider
   converting the :class:`LazyStackedTensorDict` to a contiguous
   :class:`~.TensorDict`, which can be done with the
   :meth:`LazyStackedTensorDict.to_tensordict <tensordict.LazyStackedTensorDict.to_tensordict>`
   or :meth:`LazyStackedTensorDict.contiguous <tensordict.LazyStackedTensorDict.contiguous>`
   methods.

      >>> assert isinstance(stacked_tensordict.contiguous(), TensorDict)
      >>> assert isinstance(stacked_tensordict.contiguous(), TensorDict)

   After calling either of these methods, we will have a regular :class:`TensorDict`
   containing the stacked values, and no additional computation is performed when
   values are accessed.

Concatenating ``TensorDict``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Concatenation is not done lazily, instead calling :func:`torch.cat` on a list of
:class:`~.TensorDict` instances simply returns a :class:`~.TensorDict` whose entries
are the concatenated entries of the elements of the list.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 186-192

.. code-block:: Python


    concatenated_tensordict = torch.cat([tensordict, cloned_tensordict], dim=0)

    assert concatenated_tensordict["b"].shape == torch.Size([6, 4, 5])








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 193-197

Expanding ``TensorDict``
------------------------
We can expand all of the entries of a :class:`~.TensorDict` using
:meth:`TensorDict.expand <tensordict.TensorDict.expand>`.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 197-202

.. code-block:: Python


    exp_tensordict = tensordict.expand(2, *tensordict.batch_size)
    assert exp_tensordict.batch_size == torch.Size([2, 3, 4])
    torch.testing.assert_close(exp_tensordict["a"][0], exp_tensordict["a"][1])








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 203-208

Squeezing and Unsqueezing ``TensorDict``
----------------------------------------
We can squeeze or unsqueeze the contents of a :class:`~.TensorDict` with the
:meth:`~tensordict.TensorDictBase.squeeze` and
:meth:`~tensordict.TensorDictBase.unsqueeze` methods.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 208-218

.. code-block:: Python


    tensordict = TensorDict({"a": torch.rand(3, 1, 4)}, [3, 1, 4])
    squeezed_tensordict = tensordict.squeeze()
    assert squeezed_tensordict["a"].shape == torch.Size([3, 4])
    print(squeezed_tensordict, end="\n\n")

    unsqueezed_tensordict = tensordict.unsqueeze(-1)
    assert unsqueezed_tensordict["a"].shape == torch.Size([3, 1, 4, 1])
    print(unsqueezed_tensordict)

        batch_size=torch.Size([3, 1, 4, 1]),
        device=None,
        is_shared=False)




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 219-235

.. note::
   Until now, operations like :meth:`~tensordict.TensorDictBase.unsqueeze`,
   :meth:`~tensordict.TensorDictBase.squeeze`, :meth:`~tensordict.TensorDictBase.view`,
   :meth:`~tensordict.TensorDictBase.permute`, :meth:`~tensordict.TensorDictBase.transpose`
   were all returning a lazy version of these operations (ie, a container where the original
   tensordict was stored and where the operations was applied every time a key was accessed).
   This behaviour will be deprecated in the future and can be already controlled via the
   :func:`~tensordict.utils.set_lazy_legacy` function:

      >>> with set_lazy_legacy(True):
      ...     lazy_unsqueeze = tensordict.unsqueeze(0)
      >>> with set_lazy_legacy(False):
      ...     dense_unsqueeze = tensordict.unsqueeze(0)

Bear in mind that as ever, these methods apply only to the batch dimensions. Any non
batch dimensions of the entries will be unaffected

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 235-242

.. code-block:: Python


    tensordict = TensorDict({"a": torch.rand(3, 1, 1, 4)}, [3, 1])
    squeezed_tensordict = tensordict.squeeze()
    # only one of the singleton dimensions is dropped as the other
    # is not a batch dimension
    assert squeezed_tensordict["a"].shape == torch.Size([3, 1, 4])








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 243-247

Viewing a TensorDict
--------------------
:class:`~.TensorDict` also supports ``view``. This creates a ``_ViewedTensorDict``
which lazily creates views on its contents when they are accessed.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 247-256

.. code-block:: Python


    tensordict = TensorDict({"a": torch.arange(12)}, [12])
    # no views are created at this step
    viewed_tensordict = tensordict.view((2, 3, 2))

    # the view of "a" is created on-demand when we access it
    assert viewed_tensordict["a"].shape == torch.Size([2, 3, 2])









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 257-266

Permuting batch dimensions
--------------------------
The :meth:`TensorDict.permute <tensordict.TensorDict.permute>` method can be used to
permute the batch dimensions much like :func:`torch.permute`. Non batch dimensions are
left untouched.

This operation is lazy, so batch dimensions are only permuted when we try to access
the entries. As ever, if you are likely to need to access a particular entry multiple
times, consider converting to a :class:`~.TensorDict`.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 266-274

.. code-block:: Python


    tensordict = TensorDict({"a": torch.rand(3, 4), "b": torch.rand(3, 4, 5)}, [3, 4])
    # swap the batch dimensions
    permuted_tensordict = tensordict.permute([1, 0])

    assert permuted_tensordict["a"].shape == torch.Size([4, 3])
    assert permuted_tensordict["b"].shape == torch.Size([4, 3, 5])








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 275-285

Using tensordicts as decorators
-------------------------------

For a bunch of reversible operations, tensordicts can be used as decorators.
These operations include :meth:`~tensordict.TensorDictBase.to_module` for functional
calls, :meth:`~tensordict.TensorDictBase.unlock_` and :meth:`~tensordict.TensorDictBase.lock_`
or shape operations such as :meth:`~tensordict.TensorDictBase.view`, :meth:`~tensordict.TensorDictBase.permute`
:meth:`~tensordict.TensorDictBase.transpose`, :meth:`~tensordict.TensorDictBase.squeeze` and
:meth:`~tensordict.TensorDictBase.unsqueeze`.
Here is a quick example with the ``transpose`` function:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 285-296

.. code-block:: Python


    tensordict = TensorDict({"a": torch.rand(3, 4), "b": torch.rand(3, 4, 5)}, [3, 4])

    with tensordict.transpose(1, 0) as tdt:
        tdt.set("c", torch.ones(4, 3))  # we have permuted the dims

    # the ``"c"`` entry is now in the tensordict we used as decorator:
    #

    assert (tensordict.get("c") == 1).all()








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 297-302

Gathering values in ``TensorDict``
----------------------------------
The :meth:`TensorDict.gather <tensordict.TensorDict.gather>` method can be used to
index along the batch dimensions and gather the results into a single dimension much
like :func:`torch.gather`.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 302-308

.. code-block:: Python


    index = torch.randint(4, (3, 4))
    gathered_tensordict = tensordict.gather(dim=1, index=index)
    print("index:\n", index, end="\n\n")
    print("tensordict['a']:\n", tensordict["a"], end="\n\n")
    print("gathered_tensordict['a']:\n", gathered_tensordict["a"], end="\n\n")
