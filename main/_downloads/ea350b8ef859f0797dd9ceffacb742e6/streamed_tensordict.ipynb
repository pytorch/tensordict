        "\n# Building tensordicts from streams\n\n**Author**: [Vincent Moens](https://github.com/vmoens)\n\nIn many real-world applications, data is generated continuously and at varying frequencies.\n\nFor example, sensor readings from IoT devices, financial transactions, or social media updates can all produce streams\nof data that need to be processed and analyzed in real-time.\n\nWhen working with such data streams, it's often necessary to \"bucketize\" the incoming data into discrete chunks,\nallowing for efficient processing and analysis. However, this can be challenging when dealing with data streams that\nhave different frequencies or formats.\n\nIn this tutorial, we'll explore how to use TensorDict to build and manipulate data streams.\nWe'll learn how to create lazy stacks of tensors, handle asynchronous data streams, and densify our data for efficient\nstorage and processing.\n\nIn this tutorial, you will learn:\n- How to read streams of data and write them at regular intervals within a tensordict;\n- How to build TensorDict that stack contents with heterogeneous shapes together;\n- How to densify these tensors in single storages using ``nested_tensor`` if required.\n\n## Stacking heterogeneous tensordicts together\n\nIn many real-life scenarios, data come in streams that have different defined frequencies.\n\nOur goal in this tutorial is to \"bucketize\" the upcoming data such that it can be read and processed at a given\nslower frequency.\nThe challenge in this scenario is that the data may not be representable in regular \"rectangular\" format (i.e., where\neach dimension of the tensor is well-defined), but it could be the case that one bucket of data has more element than\nanother, in which case we cannot simply stack them together. Typically, consider the case where the first and second\nbuckets of data are as follows:\n"
